	Polar Grid Motion
	-----------------

	Utilizing a repeat polar grid to plot objects moving along a transcendental rose 
    curve path.

	I wanted to post something nice and simple that the average GPU could handle. This 
    was inspired in part by Vovosunt's "Dots and Spirals," but was based on Fabrice's 
    original "rosace 3" example. They say small things amuse small minds, and at the 
    time, that particular example kept me busy for ages. :)

	The particle movement is pretty standard. Each object moves in a circular path with a 
    varying radius and Z position based on transcendental functions according to angular 
    position. For anyone not quite familiar with it, I've provided some links below.

	The only mildly tricky bit was the rendering process. That involved keeping track of
	potentially overlapping objects, then sorting prior to rendering. There are three
	polar partitioned grids overlapping one another, but arranged radially and depthwise
	to look like they form a continuous closed curve. Potential overlapping objects
	consist of three overlapping polar cells (one for each loop) and each of their adjacent 
    polar neighbors (the two on either side). That's nine altogether, which is not very 
    taxing on the average GPU. Therefore, I wouldn't expect any frame rate problems.

	I've tried to keep things relatively simple, but there's still a bit of esoteric 
	dressing up code in there. For anyone who'd like to make something similar, you'd be 
    better off starting from scratch, then using this, Vovosunt's or Fabrices example as 
    a guide.
	
	Anyway, I'd call this a pseudo 3D example. At some stage, I'll try to come up with a
	raymarched variation. By the way, there's a "TRANSPARENT" and "RANDOM_VARIATION" 
	define below, for anyone bored enough to try them. :)
